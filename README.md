# BackEND
*I am learning BackEND, the Serverside programming. This is a my BackEND PlayGround. A collection for my BackEND and Serverside Codes.*  

HERE I test out every new thing I learn,  and practice the concepts I'm weak at. Sometimes even brush up my skills, or just code some BackEND for fun!!'Cause I LOVE BackEND!!! 



## **Important BackEND Points:**
*NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, CRUD, API, Auth, OAUTH, RoleBasedAuth, REST,  GraphQL, PassportJS, Socket.io, PWA*
